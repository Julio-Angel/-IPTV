        <h3>PURPOSE:</h3>
        <p>
            Plex has a limit to the amount of Live TV channles that it can support (480 IPTV Channles). This is a list of
            Channles that are my personal favorite and legal to use. My playlists already contain links to all guides, 
            players with x-tvg-url tag support should load it automatically.
        </p>
